## Description

This is a simple budget tracker that demonstrates the power of indexedDB and service workers. It allows users to create transactions to add or subtract money from an account, which is reflected by a graph beneath the form.

The service worker is set up to cache the priority files, allowing it to load more quickly and offline.

It also has indexedDB set up to allow users to submit transactions when offline or when they have poor internet. Those transactions will then go through when they go back online.

Lastly, there is a manifest, with the entire application allowing users to install it by clicking the icon in the right part of the address bar.

The application uses MongoDB to store the transaction data.

Here is a link to the live application on [Heroku](https://budgeitnow.herokuapp.com/).
